# ResNet Image Classifier

This project implements a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The implementation showcases the effectiveness of ResNets in handling the vanishing gradients problem in deep neural networks, thus allowing the training of very deep networks.
